        Stanley was born in Gig Harbor, Washington. He was a 2002 graduate of St. Charles Borromeo elementary and middle school and a 2006 graduate of Bellarmine Preparatory School (both Catholic schools located in Tacoma, Washington).
          Stanley turned professional after the 2009 U.S. Open and made his pro debut a week later at the Travelers Championship. Late in 2010, Stanley earned a 2011 PGA Tour card through Q-School where he finished in a tie for ninth. In his debut season on tour, he recorded four top-10 finishes, with the best of these coming at the John Deere Classic where he finished runner-up to Steve Stricker by a single stroke. The runner-up finish did however help Stanley secure the final available spot at the 2011 Open Championship. It was his first ever appearance in an Open Championship and he made the cut to finish in a tie for 44th. He also made the third FedEx Cup playoff event, the BMW Championship, finishing tied for 10th, though that wasn't good enough to provide entrance to the final event of the year, The Tour Championship. He finished the 2011 season 55th on the PGA Tour money list and 148th on the Official World Golf Ranking.

      <h2>2012: Torrey Pines collapse and Scottsdale comeback</h2>
      <p>
In January 2012, Stanley looking for his maiden win on the PGA Tour, surrendered a six-shot lead during the final round of the Farmers Insurance Open. He started the day with a six stroke advantage over the rest of the field and at one stage during the final round extended this to seven strokes. As he approached the final hole, Stanley led by three strokes over Brandt Snedeker with just the par-five 18th to play. However, after laying up with his second shot, he spun his approach off the green and into the water hazard. After taking a penalty drop, he found the back edge of the green and three putted to record a triple-bogey eight on the final hole of regulation to result in a sudden-death playoff with Snedeker. After replaying the 18th and both making birdie, Snedeker won the tournament on the second playoff hole with a par after Stanley once again three putted the green.

The following week, Stanley came back from eight shots behind 54 hole leader Spencer Levin at the Waste Management Phoenix Open in Scottsdale for his first PGA Tour win. Stanley shot a final round bogey-free 65 for a one stroke victory over Ben Crane. The eight shot comeback win was also tied for third in the largest final round comeback by a winner in PGA Tour history.

Stanley briefly moved into the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking by virtue of his quarter-finalist finish at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, peaking at 47. Consistent play without top ten finishes resulted in a slide outside the top 50 as the season continued. Stanley was also ranked among the "hottest" golfers on tour.

<h2>Since 2013</h2>
        Stanley struggled on the PGA Tour following his breakout season. Stanley had two third-places in 2013 which allowed him to finish 62nd on the PGA Tour's money list. In 2014 Stanley only had one top-ten and finished 148th on the PGA Tour's money list, and thereby lost his full-time PGA Tour status. In 2015 Stanley split his time on both the PGA Tour and the Web.com Tour. He played well in the year-end Web.com Tour Final series to earn his PGA Tour card again for the 2016 season.
